Currently i'm only just displaying the blocks
x is the x coordinate and is incremented by v
y is the y coordinate and is incremented by 40.5
z is the variable used to put the block on the values following the initial one
it is resetted to y everytime 
so to check and implement indices in the board array
we first create a check function to check the indices before moving the block 
the indices at the start will all be 0 
then as the block continues to move and as it reaches y coordinate of 777.5 we stop it
check the rotatiom and the block type
and then use the setboard function to set the value in the board
once the values are set , the sprite dynamic array will be deleted and a new tetromino will begin to fall
if the board has values greater than 0 in a row
the row disappears
